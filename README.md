# Hi!

Welcome to my website!

In the future, all of my projects will be indexed here.

***

This is my website. There are only a few Projects I have so far, which include my C tutorial, a blog, and some other shit. I just registered this domain recently, so I'm just getting this up and running.

Visit the website [here][site]!

***

Update: The site is **no longer hosted by Github Pages**. Check out my [main site][site] and enjoy. I may scrap this site sometime in the future, but for now, everything has been moved to a legitimate domain.

Initially, I wanted this to be purely HTML-based, which was simple. However, I realized that it would not work (static sites suck) and I registered nishantkompella.me and hosted it using InfinityFree.
